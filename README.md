# Non-radiation-3D-spine-deformation-evaluation-system
Spinal screening relies mainly on direct clinical diagnosis or X-ray examination (which generates harmful radioactive exposure to human body). In general, the lack of knowledge in
this area will prevent parents to discover adolescents’ spinal deformation problems at children’s early age. Therefore, I propose a low-cost, easy to use, radiation free and high accuracy method to quickly reconstruct the three-dimensional
shape of the spine, which can be used to evaluation of spinal deformation.
