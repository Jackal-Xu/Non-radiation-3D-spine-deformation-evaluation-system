# Non-radiation-3D-spine-deformation-evaluation-system
Spinal screening relies mainly on direct clinical diagnosis or X-ray examination (which generates harmful radioactive exposure to human body). In general, the lack of knowledge in this area will prevent parents to discover adolescents’ spinal deformation problems at children’s early age. Therefore, I propose a low-cost, easy to use, radiation free and high accuracy method to quickly reconstruct the three-dimensional shape of the spine, which can be used to evaluation of spinal deformation.

The algorithm is purely based on 2D/3D imaging processing and mathematic modeling. We are trying to admit the advanced DL method to optimize the parameter to increase the accuracy and robustness of the system.

By the way, I'm figure out to transfer this technical into product. If anyone wants to devote into the human posture analysis filed, please feel free to cantact me!
